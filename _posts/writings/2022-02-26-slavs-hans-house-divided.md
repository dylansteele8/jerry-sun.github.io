The conflict in Ukraine is unavoidable on the Internet and with it brings a host of takes. Most of them, I think, hit the nail on the head: War is devastating, citizens in both countries are victims, nothing good will happen from this. 

A bit of strategic analysis I keep seeing is how the war affects China's relationship with Taiwan, ergo, because Russia is attacking Ukraine and the West *appears* weak, that somehow China's rumored invasion of Taiwan is going to be imminent. That seems flawed for a variety of reasons but I have no foresight on whether or not this will happen today, tomorrow, next year, or ever. What do I know? It's difficult if not impossible to understand what the leaderhip in China is thinking. 

What I will note is it's heartening to see many Russians protesting the war. Let's be clear, this ongoing fight is not a war among people of differing cultures and backgrounds and experiences. Russians and Ukrainians are both Slavs; they are brothers and its unsurprising to read the morale of the young men, at least on the Russian side, is low. No Ukrainian wants to see Kyiv burn just as no Russian wants to see Kiev burn.

I expect this to be the same between China and Taiwan should fighting break out. Residents living in the mainland have families in Taiwan and vice versa. There is a difference in ideology but I've always understood there to be a sense of family between the two regions. It would be a tragedy to see what's happening today occur over the South China Sea. Though it's too late for Slavs, we can still hope to never see a day of Hans fighting each other.
