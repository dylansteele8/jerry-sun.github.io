<p> My name is Jerry. Welcome to my page. </p>
<p> I'm a research analyst at <a href="https://www.messari.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Messari</a>, a crypto investment research and data analytics firm based in New York. I was previously a management consultant out of Chicago. </p>
<p> My research interests include infrastructure, crypto-native businesses, zero-knowledge applications, and practical real-world use cases for blockchains. On this blog, you'll find that and a bit more. </p>
<p> In my free time, I enjoy traveling, supporting Seattle sports teams, and breaking out of silver elo in League of Legends. </p>
