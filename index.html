<p> I'm Jerry. Welcome to my page. </p>
<p> I'm a research analyst at <a href="https://www.messari.io">Messari</a>, a crypto investment research and data analytics firm based in New York. </p>
<p> My research interests include crypto-native businesses, ZK proof functionality, and practical real-world applications for blockchains. On this blog, you'll find that and a bit more. </p>
<p> In my free time, I enjoy playing a bit of poker, cycling around San Francisco, supporting Seattle sports teams, and trying to make it in League of Legends. </p>
