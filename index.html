Hey there. Welcome to my page.
<br>
<br>
I'm a research analyst at <a href="https://www.messari.io">Messari</a>, a crypto investment research and data analytics firm based in New York. 
<br>
<br>
My research interests include crypto-native businesses, ZK proof functionality, and practical real-world applications for blockchains. On this blog, you'll find that... and a bit more.
<br>
<br>
In my free time, I enjoy playing a bit of poker, cycling around San Francisco, supporting Seattle sports teams, and trying to make it in League of Legends.
