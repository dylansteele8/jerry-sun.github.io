The news was a lot to process and unsurprisingly, the crypto community was left amused and shocked.</p><p>Let’s break things down here. First off, this is crazy. I mean, this is a country we’re talking about here, not a crypto protocol. Second, there’s a war going on, for Christ’s sake! People in crypto joke about hanging out in a weird, separate corner of the Internet but this airdrop thing has officially made it big time. I still believe we’re early but at the same time, are we really?</p><p>Now, this could totally be me being uninformed but does anybody know exactly how these funds will be used? Are they to buy weapons? Are they for humanitarian aid? Are the end users soldiers or terrorized Ukranian civilians? Typically when donations come into play, people like to get some more detail before making decisions but these are, to repeat once again, very serious times.</p><p>You can take a look at this Dune Analytics <a href="https://dune.xyz/leoubbiali/Ukraine-ETH-Donations">dashboard</a> by @leoubbiali showing the hour-by-hour breakdown of ETH donated to the account. Note, it seems like Ukraine is running multiple wallets for each of the various networks (Bitcoin, Polkadot, and I believe Solana donations are all accepted) so the dashboard isn’t going to show total donations. But it does reflect trends and a significant surge in donations was observed today as compared to previous days.</p><p>What does that tell us? Clearly people care more about the rewards (airdrop) than the actual cause. Sadly, donors giving money purely from the goodness of their heart are few and far between…</p><p>Rekt did a <a href="https://rekt.news/airdrop-siren/">piece</a> on the future implications of airdrops now that they’re outside the realm of crypto-native projects. This was their takeaway:</p><blockquote><p>“The sudden increase in donations after the confirmation of an airdrop has left many critical of the motives of the post-announcement donors, suggesting that donating should never come with any ulterior motive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We will never know what percentage of these donors are seeking profit, and which were simply encouraged by a promise of public proof of support.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>After all, it seems unlikely that the airdrop would have any monetary value, and perhaps it would be better that way.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Crypto users often operate within a self-created echo chamber, disconnected from reality, and in this situation, that has had a positive result.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>However, this will not be the last politically flavoured airdrop. Public greed can be frictionlessly utilised thanks to Web 3.0, and it would not be surprising to see this technique influence an election in the future.”</p></blockquote><p>How will this change the way we live our life? Who knows. Welcome to our new world, I suppose.</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2022-03-02T00:00:00-08:00">March 2, 2022</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/writings">writings</a></span></section></main></body></html>
